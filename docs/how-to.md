# Learn Kyanos in 5 Minutes

Kyanos has three main subcommands: `watch`, `stat`, and `overview`. Here’s what
each command does:

1. **watch**: Captures network traffic according to specified options and
   automatically parses it into request-response records.
2. **stat**: Aggregates request-response records based on specified conditions,
   providing higher-level statistical information.
3. **overview**: Displays external resources that the current machine relies on
   in a single command.

## Basic Usage of Traffic Capture with `watch`

The simplest usage captures all protocols traffic currently supported by Kyanos:

```bash
./kyanos watch
```

Each request-response record is displayed as a row in a table. You can use the
arrow keys or `j/k` to move up and down through the records:
![kyanos watch result](/watch-result.jpg)

Press `Enter` to access the details view:

![kyanos watch result detail](/watch-result-detail.jpg)

In the details view, the first section is **Latency Details**. Each block
represents a "node" that the data packet passes through, such as the process,
network interface, and socket buffer.  
Each block includes a time value indicating the time elapsed from the previous
node to this node, showing the process flow from the process sending the request
to the network interface, to the response being copied to the socket buffer, and
finally read by the process, with each step’s duration displayed.

The second section provides **Detailed Request and Response Content**, split
into Request and Response parts, and truncates content over `1024` bytes.

For more precise traffic capture, such as HTTP traffic:

```bash
./kyanos watch http
```

You can narrow it down further to capture traffic for a specific HTTP path:

```bash
./kyanos watch http --path /abc
```

Each protocol has different filtering options. For more details, see:
[How to Capture Request-Response and Latency Details](./watch)

## Basic Usage of Aggregated Analysis with `stat`

In real-world scenarios, `watch` output is often too granular. Therefore, Kyanos
offers the `stat` command for **statistical analysis**.

In short, `stat` can help answer questions like: Which connections have the
highest request count? Which remote servers have the highest average latency?
Which clients consume the most bandwidth?

For example, to find remote servers with the highest average latency, use the
`--slow` option to focus on latency. Like `watch`, `stat` can apply all
filtering options supported by `watch`. Here, we’ll collect only HTTP requests
with `PATH=/abc`:

```bash
./kyanos stat http --slow --path /abc
```

By default, Kyanos will collect data for 10 seconds (modifiable with the
`--time` option, or press `ctrl+c` to stop early):
![kyanos stat slow result](/qs-stat-slow.jpg)

After 10 seconds, the collected results are displayed in a table:

```js{6-8}

```

Each row in the `watch` output represents a single request-response, while
`stat` aggregates request-responses by a specified dimension.

In this example, since no specific dimension was set, **the remote server
address (remote-ip)** is used as the default aggregation dimension (displayed in
the second column). This means that request-responses from the same remote IP
are aggregated together (though this is just one way to aggregate; for more
options, refer to [Traffic Analysis](./stat)).

Let's shift our focus to each column of the table: the `max` column shows the
maximum latency among the aggregated request-responses for each remote IP, while
the `avg` column shows the average latency, and so on. If an issue arises with a
remote server, you can quickly identify the problematic server by comparing
metrics for different remote IPs, such as noticing an anomaly for IP
`169.254.0.4`.

To view detailed request-response information for a specific remote IP, move
cursor to that row and press `Enter` to access the list of request-responses for
that remote-ip:

The format of the display here is actually the same as that shown by the `watch`
command—each row represents a request-response record. You can further explore
each record by pressing `Enter` to view detailed latency and content information
for the selected request.
