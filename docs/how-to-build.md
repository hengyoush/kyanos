# Compilation Steps

This document describes the local compilation method for kyanos. My environment is Ubuntu 22.04, and other environments may vary.

## Tool Version Requirements

- golang 1.23 or above
- clang 10.0 or above
- llvm 10.0 or above

## Installation of Compilation Environment Dependencies
### Ubuntu
If you are using Ubuntu 22.04 or later, you can initialize the compilation environment with a single command.
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hengyoush/kyanos/refs/heads/main/init_env.sh)"
```
### Other Linux Distributions
clone the project (don't forget to update submodle!):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hengyoush/kyanos
cd kyanos
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
In addition to the toolchain versions listed above, the compilation environment also requires the following software. Please install them manually.

- linux-tools-common
- linux-tools-generic
- pkgconf
- libelf-dev


## Compilation Commands

If you are just developing and testing locally, you can execute
```
make build-bpf && make
```

the kyanos executable file will be generated in the root directory of the project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note that this binary file does not include the BTF files from [btfhub-archive](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub-archive/). If you run this kyanos on a lower version kernel without BTF support, it may fail to start. You can build a kyanos artifact with embedded BTF files using the following commands:
> ::: code-group
>```bash [x86_64]
>make build-bpf && make btfgen BUILD_ARCH=x86_64 ARCH_BPF_NAME=x86 && make
>```
>
>```bash [arm64]
>make build-bpf && make btfgen BUILD_ARCH=arm64 ARCH_BPF_NAME=arm64 && make
>```
>:::
> Note that make btfgen may take more than 15 minutes.

> [!TIP]
>If your kernel does not have BTF enabled, you may not be able to start kyanos successfully.
>
>Check if BTF is enabled:
>```
>grep CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF "/boot/config-$(uname -r)"
>```
>If the result is `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y`, it means BTF is enabled. If not, please download the BTF file corresponding to your kernel version from [mirrors.openanolis.cn](https://mirrors.openanolis.cn/coolbpf/btf/) or [btfhub-archive](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub-archive/), and use the `--btf` option to specify the downloaded BTF file when starting kyanos.
